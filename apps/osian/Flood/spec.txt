The Flood application is used for high-traffic network testing.  It
transmits UDP packets direct to a gateway node at a specified rate.  The
length of the packets and the rate is dynamically controllable.  The
transmission can be inhibited.

Each transmitted packet contains:
- Time since boot in binary milliseconds
- Total number of transmission since boot

In addition to its primary function, the application responds to ping and to
UDP echo requests.

B0 -- Toggle to enable/disable transmission of packets
B1 -- Press to cycle through inter-packet transmission delays
B2 -- Press to cycle through packet payload lengths
B3 -- Press to display system status

Green -- Toggles on transmission of a packet
Red -- Lit if EBUSY is returned for a transmission
Blue -- Lit if transmission is enabled

Extras:

ipi[,7] -- Set default inter-packet interval exponent (7 = 128bms)
multicast -- Transmit to multicast address instead of unicast

Future Variation points
- Randomize inter-packet delay
- Randomize packet length
