* Toolchain:

The focus is on getting the new toolchain verified.  As such this repo is
intended to be tested using the new toolchain (mspgcc 4.5, uniarch, ti headers).

Some testing with the old 3.2.3 toolchain (original tinyos and z1 varient) has
also been done for simple function (ie. does it compile).


* Repo Structure

github.com/tinyprod/prod: main TinyProd repo.
  The VeryBless repo.  Hold the stable mainline (master)

github.com/tp-freeforall/prod: working fork.
  Blessed repo.  Holds consolidated integration branches and
  proposed updates.

github.com/<github_user>/prod: user's tinyprod working fork.
  branched off tp-freeforall/prod.   working branches
  should be branched off the tp-freeforall/prod(branch)
  that the user is working on.



main persistent branches:

svn/upstream: svn tinyos tracking branch.

master: the main tinyprod release line.

next: integration branch for next release on master.

pu:   integration branch for proposed updates.

<feature>-int: integration branch for feature
<feature>-int-pu: proposed update.
<feature>-int-next: accepted updates.

(some of these branches may be skipped depending on need).



Other current branches:

msp430-int: msp430 integration (msp430 core, x1, x2, x5) feature branch

msp430-int-pu: proposed updates to msp430-int (no msp430-int-next).

swreset: potential msp430 swreset implementation.

motenet-rel: replacement for the serialforwarder.

svn-vhsb: remove bad z1 commit from svn trunk

(note: tinyprod's master branch will eventually consist of a merge between
msp430-int, svn-vhsb, swreset, and motenet-rel).



user branches are working branches in user working forks.

* Branches:

svn-upstream: is the main branch coming from the svn t2 mainline.  Updated manually.

svn-vhsb: (vogon hyper-spatial bypass)  Bypass the Z1 commits on the main
	trunk.  This branch tracks master but has the superfluous Z1 commit
	removed as it conflicts with the collapsed msp430 x2xxx work done in
	mm_core.  This collapsage forms the majority of the work of merging
	the trees and there isn't much sense in reinventing the wheel.

msp430-int: main consolidation branch for the msp430 core.   It represents the
	current released version of the branch.

       includes all three major families (x1, x2, and x5).  Major cpu dependancies
       held in tos/chips/msp430/{x1xxx,x2xxx,x5xxx}

z1-pu: working directory for Zolertia modifications.



Workflow:  (github user: Robert Hunter)

    on github, fork github.com/tp-freeforall/prod  (as Robert Hunter)
       (this creates the github repo, github.com/roberthunter/prod)

    mkdir -p ~/working/msp430
    cd ~/working/msp430
    git clone git@github.com:roberthunter/prod.git tinyos-2.x
    cd tinyos-2.x
    git remote add up git://github.com/tp-freeforall/prod.git
    git fetch up
    git checkout msp430-int               # make sure on the msp430-int branch
    git checkout -b rh                    # create the rh branch off msp430-int

Robert Hunter makes changes and commits his working branch (rh) on his local
repo (local).  This gets pushed to github/roberthunter/prod.git and lives as
the rh branch in that repo.

The integrator pulls these changes after review into the
tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int-pu) branch.   After other changes from other
developers comes in and msp430-int-pu has sufficiently matured, msp430-int-pu
is merged into tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int).

When all integration branches have matured sufficiently, they are merged
together, tested, and becomes tinyprod/prod(master).


While various integration work is being done, working branches should be
refreshed with more current content from the integration repositories.

For example, Robert wants to make sure that his changes are consistent with
what is happening on the tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int-pu) branch.  He
accomplishes this by the following commands:

    cd ~/working/msp430/tinyos-2.x
    git fetch up                         # get current information from
    	      				 # tp-freeforall

    git checkout rh                      # make sure on rh branch
    git merge up/msp430-int-pu           # merge in the current
                                         # proposed integration branch
