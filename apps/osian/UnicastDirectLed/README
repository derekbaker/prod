This application demonstrates basic UDP monitoring and control over a direct
PPP link to an OSIAN device.

The application generically maintains a counter, which it increments once
per second, reflecting the lower four bits of the counter value in the LEDs.
When the lower four bits are zero, it generates a Counter Rollover event.
It also generates a Button event when button zero is pressed.  It can
receive a Reset Counter command over the network; upon receipt, it does
reset its counter, and generates a Reset Counter event.

Each event is converted to a UDP packet and transmitted to the remote
address of the PPP connection.  The event structure comprises the current
application uptime in milliseconds, the current counter value, and the event
tag.

Led4 is lit while the PPP link is active.  If the link is down, events are
not sent over the network.

There is an accompanying python program, test.py, which receives events from
the application, displaying them on the screen.  Periodically it will send a
reset command.

How to use:

1. Build and install the application:

  make surf osian install

2. In one terminal, bring up the PPP link.  It is suggested you use a PPP
   daemon with OSIAN printf support enabled.

  sudo OSIAN_PPPD=${OSIAN_PPPD} ${OSIAN_ROOT}/bin/osianpppd

   Wait until the link is established (

3. In another window, run the Python program which monitors events and
generates commands:

  python test.py
