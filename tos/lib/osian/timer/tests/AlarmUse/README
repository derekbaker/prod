For full tests, do:

1) Test builds of all variants for different alarm counts:

  sh buildset.sh

   This also shows that only four timers are available when usemux is off,
   and displays the size in ROM and RAM for each configuration.

2) Test multiple millisecond timers:

  make surf osian usemux,1 install

   Led N should toggle at 8/(2^N) times per second

3) Test multiple whole-second timers

  make surf osian usemux,1 useprec,Second install

   Led N should toggle at 2^N second intervals
