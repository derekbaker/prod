tos/interfaces/platform is used to hold interface files that define parts of
the TinyOS to Platform interface. The intent is these interfaces form a
common set of platform interfaces across cpus and platforms. A roadmap of
consistent functionality potentially provided by the platforms.

For example, the msp430 provides at least two mechanisms for generating a
swreset, watchdog violation (x1 and x2 families) and via PMMSWPOR in the
power management module (x5 family). The watchdog violation however
doesn't produce a clean h/w reset and auxiliary code must be executed to clean
the h/w up prior to restarting (SWResetInit).

Code for the msp430 families is provided by tos/chips/msp430/SWReset{C,P}.nc.
It is simple enough that these files provide a unified SWReset driver for all
three major msp430 families.

tos/chips/msp430/SWReset{C,P}.nc handles SWReset for the msp430 platforms,
while SWReset (the interface) is intended to be used not only on the msp430
platforms but other platforms that provides SWReset.

SWReset.nc: defines reset (SWReset.reset) Cause the software system to reset.

SWResetInit: uses the standard Init (../Init.nc) interface. Under certain
    circumstances, the h/w may not be returned to a pristine reset state.
    (see early msp430 code). SWResetInit is used in those situations to
    allow a platform to wire in code that will clear these conditions out
    from start up code. (SWResetInit is wired in via Platform{C,P}.nc).
