This directory contains a collection of components that aid in debugging
TinyOS programs.

Each capability is made available through a standard component.  The
implementation of the component is replaced by a stub with the NDEBUG
preprocessor symbol is defined to a non-zero value.

DisplayCode - Infrastructure to display an error code on the device LEDs,
either in the background or as a sort of kernel-panic.  Each code provides
its own interface to control it.  Codes may be associated with values, which
are also displayed through the LEDs.
