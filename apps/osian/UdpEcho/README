This is a primary test for OSIAN IP.  It is a simple application that
supports ping and the UDP echo service.

1. Add the following lines to your /etc/hosts.  This allows you to reference
   the PPP endpoints by name.

  fe80::fd41:4242:e88:2 host.ppp.osian
  fe80::fd41:4242:e88:3 device.ppp.osian

2. Build and install the application on a device:

  make surf osian dco,16 install bsl,/dev/ttyUSB0

   Changing the DCO to 16MHz avoids periodic UART overruns at 115200 which
   can cause roughly 3% UDP packet drops on this test.

3. Run the osianpppd script which will build a command line for the PPP
   daemon and invoke it.  Note that since pppd requires root privileges,
   this must be run as root.

  sudo OSIAN_PPPD=${OSIAN_PPPD} ${OSIAN_ROOT}/bin/osianpppd

4. Use the IPv6 version of the ping command to test network connectivity.
   Note that, since the device is assigned a link-local address, you may
   need to tell ping6 which interface to use:

  ping6 -I ppp0 device.ppp.osian

5. Basic test of the echo service.  This requires the netcat program, and
   sends the standard input to nc over UDP using Ipv6 (-6u) to echo service
   running on port 7 of the device.  netcat doesn't seem to use hostname
   lookup properly, so we use the scope-qualified address:

  echo This is a test | nc -6u fe80::fd41:4242:e88:3%ppp0 7

6. Finally, use the echoperf.py Python program to determine the overall
   performance of the echo service.  This program repeatedly transmits
   packets to the service, recording how many are transmitted and received,
   and periodically printing a summary of results.

  python echoperf.py -l 120

   Packets smaller than 120 octets will work; larger than that may run up
   against MTU limits within the default PPP configuration.
